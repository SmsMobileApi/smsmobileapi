Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here are a few things about me:

    ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on SMS Mobile API, a powerful service for sending SMS via mobile devices, with no third-party providers needed.
    ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about artificial intelligence, home renovation, and the art of understanding my kids.
    ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on SMS Mobile API with talented people who are passionate about APIs and mobile tech.
    ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with expanding the SMS Mobile API service worldwide and reaching more customers.

What is SMS Mobile API?

SMS Mobile API is a solution I developed with the goal of giving businesses the freedom to send SMS notifications without relying on third-party providers. Instead, they can use their own mobile phones to send messages directly from their website, software, scripts, or other applications.

This approach offers several benefits:

    Cost Savings: Messages are sent using the mobile phoneâ€™s own plan, meaning businesses can send SMS for free or at a minimal cost.
    Independence: Thereâ€™s no need to depend on external SMS gateways or providers, giving businesses more control and flexibility.
    Simple Integration: With our API, companies can easily integrate SMS functionality into their existing platforms, whether itâ€™s a website, software, or any other system.

Since the launch of SMS Mobile API, Iâ€™ve learned a lot about optimizing APIs for seamless performance, especially in handling mobile communication directly. The feedback from companies has been incredible, and Iâ€™ve gained deep insights into how to create scalable, secure, and user-friendly APIs.
The Vision

My mission with SMS Mobile API is simple: I want to make it easy for businesses, no matter their size, to send SMS notifications at a low cost, without being tied down to expensive third-party services. By giving them the tools to send messages through their own devices, we help them reduce costs and operate independently.

From the beginning, this project has been a journey of growth for me. Iâ€™ve learned the importance of creating solutions that are both powerful and user-friendly. Every iteration of the API has been refined to provide the best possible experience for developers and end-users alike.

Iâ€™m constantly working on improving the platform and expanding its reach so that more businesses around the world can take advantage of this unique, cost-saving service.
